# Refactoring an open-source Pacman game

Now that you've learned the basic refactoring techniques and how you can make use an IDE, you are ready to take on a real challenge!

Your task is to refactor this [Pacman remake](pacman) as well as you can. If you don't know where to start, here are a couple of tips:
- Open the project in your IDE
- Look at the overall file structure: would you group the files differently, i.e. into packages / folders? If yes, how?
- Go through the files: are there dependencies (superclass / interface) and do they make sense? Which ones would you add / remove?
- Check if the IDE sees any smells
- Only refactor small parts at a time, and check that you didn't break anything (either by writing tests before refactoring or by actually running the game)

Good luck! :smile:

> :information_source: If you're interested, you can find many other open-source games hosted on GitHub [here](https://github.com/topics/java-game).

> You can also setup Code Climate to find more code smells. You'll have to publish your code to a new GitHub repo and then add it to Code Climate [here](https://codeclimate.com/login/github/join).
