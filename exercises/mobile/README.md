# Mobile platform architecture

In this exercise set, you will apply some of the concepts introduced in the course in an Android environment. This is a very realistic environment in which to apply your new knowledge (as it's used a lot to develop real software shipped to real users). It is also the environment in which you will develop next semester in the SDP (Software Development Project) course.
