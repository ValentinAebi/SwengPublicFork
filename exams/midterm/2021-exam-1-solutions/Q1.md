# Question 1: From feedback to story [8 points]

Welcome to your new job working on SuperQuiz, the trendy app that lets everyone design quizzes and share them with friends!
Your first assignment is to add a new feature that is requested by users.
You are given the following transcript of an interview with a customer of your product:

> Hi!
> So you're the developer of this quiz app?
> The one where you write questions and answers and get your friends to guess?
> It's fun, but I can't use it as much as I'd like.
> I'm a firefighter, I don't have time for this app during the day, but I wish I could use it at home.
> See, when I come back home after work, I have a bunch of stuff to do, cleaning, cooking, ...
> And when I'm doing these tasks, I'm rather busy. Not like when I'm watching TV.
> I don't always have my phone in my hands! Sometimes I even forget where I put it.
> Maybe if you made it so I could talk to the app? You know, many apps have that feature now.
> Then I could multitask! Think about quizzes while I'm cooking!
> Otherwise, I won't use the app much.

Write down a user story that summarizes this transcript:

> As a multitasker, I want the app to be usable with voice only, so that I can use it when my hands are busy.

_You get 4 points if your user story summarizes all necessary information in the transcript and 4 more points if your user story does not contain any unnecessary information._
