# Question 3: Compromising with the CEO [15 points]

SuperQuiz recently hired a new CEO, who wants to improve the development practices using modern methods.
However, this CEO has no engineering background, so the suggested improvements are well intentioned but not always feasible.

The latest CEO suggestion is this:

> Continuous Integration is a modern best practice. We must adopt it, so that the code in our repository never has bugs.
> From now on, all branches in the SuperQuiz repository must have continuous integration enabled,
> and at the end of each day all branches must pass all tests.

Give two reasons (1 sentence each) explaining why the goal and implementation of the CEO's suggestion go too far:

1. Continuous integration, even paired with tests, cannot guarantee the code "never has bugs"

2. Feature branches should be allowed to fail tests, otherwise developers will not commit enough and risk losing data

Propose (in 1-2 sentences) a compromise that achieves the CEO's true objective:

> Continous integration should be set up for the main branch, to reduce the likelihood of bugs in the final product
